* My cat (and I) made it onto the JHU CS department [webpage](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/news/computer-scientist-ama-koranteng-says-playing-strategic-video-games-developed-her-problem-solving-skills/)!

* I contributed to a [CSforALL blog post](https://csforall.medium.com/3-young-voices-and-their-pathways-to-careers-in-the-tech-industry-bad39616390f) touching on challenges low-income college students may face when pursing tech careers.

* [Article](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/news/nsf-fellowship-awarded-to-two-cs-graduate-students/) from the JHU CS department on my NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

* I was featured (along with 11 cool women in CS!) in a [blog](https://amysmartgirls.com/the-future-of-computer-science-and-tech-12-young-women-to-watch-part-2-334c2282025d) by Amy Poehler's Smart Girls.
