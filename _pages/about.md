Hello! I'm a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), where I'm advised by [Michael Dinitz](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdinitz/). My research interests are generally in theoretical computer science, and more specifically in graph and approximation algorithms. I am supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). 

Before starting my Ph.D., I earned a B.S. in Mathematics from the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/).
